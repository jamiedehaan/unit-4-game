Crystals Collector!

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals. Each crystal is assigned a value. It is possible for multiple crystals to have the same value. When you click on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

Each time the game starts, the random number and the values of each crystal will change.
